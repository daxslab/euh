# euh

[euh](https://github.com/daxslab/euh) is a helper for ETECSA USSD codes.

## Why euh

__euh__ is an acronym for **E**TECSA **U**SSD **H**elper, and is written in an effort to make easy for users to use USSD codes without having to learn them by heart. Since those days ETECSA has been changing their USSD [interface](https://twitter.com/luilver/status/1198324230636679168) it is hard to mantain apps compatibility with it.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
